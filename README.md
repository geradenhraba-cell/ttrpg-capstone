<h3>Overview</h3>

I wanted to explore the trends of Tabletop roleplaying games from various crowdfunding sites to see what kind of systems tend to get funded over others. By looking at several websites and pulling data from each and then comparing each indivudally to compare at the end. By analyzing each site i can look at their funding goals, release year, rather or not they got cancelled early, funded, or lost funding to compare them. I wished to understand where and when these projects were most successful.

<h3>Motivation</h3>

TTRPG's have been a large facet of my adult and adolecent life. I wished to see if there was any significant growth in the kickstarter community, and to see which type of RPG's are most likely to succeed or not. I wanted to see where the scene has changed over the years if one type of game was by far the most funded or and if there was a year where things changed drastically.

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

The data that is presented has been gathered from four websites.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

It was a challenge to organize all the data together from the four different websites, as everything did not have the same data points as one another.
I had to figure out how to properly datetime certain sections and pull just the year from the date time into a new coloumn and to figure out which of every column actually was.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I found that European countries perfer projects outside of Fifth edition. Most of the projects i looked at were funded with very few items being cancelled or not fully funded. with most projects being fully funded on Backerkit at 97%. if i had more time i would like to have looked at how many backers were backing each project and what the average donation amount for each was, or if that data is even available to be seen on the websites. I would have also liked to dive deeper into other aspects of the projects and base analsyst on the inflation rate of the currencies to present day. While 5e and related projects are by far the most popular there are a few years in which they are not and other projects out perform them.
